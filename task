1)Difference between statically typed and dynamically typed languages:
 Statically typed Language:
    It requires a compiler 
    If data type of the variable is known at the compilation time ,it is statically typed language 
    Checking for errors is done at compilation stage 
    Example: C, java
 Dynamically Typed Languages 
    It does not require a compiler 
    If data type of the variable is known at the runtime it is called dynamically typed language 
    Checking for errors is done at runtime 
    Example: Javascript ,python 

2)Scripting language vs programing language:

    Basically, all scripting languages are programming languages. 
    The theoretical difference between the two is that scripting languages do not require the compilation step and are rather interpreted. 
    For example, normally, a C program needs to be compiled before running whereas normally, a scripting language like JavaScript or PHP need not be compiled.
3)Difference between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP2:

    The primary difference is that, HTTP/1.1 sends or recieves requests in only plain text format but HTTP2 does this in binary code format. 
    HTTP2 is faster and reduces the errors.
