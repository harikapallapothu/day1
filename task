1)Difference between statically typed and dynamically typed languages:
 Statically typed Language:
    It requires a compiler 
    If data type of the variable is known at the compilation time ,it is statically typed language 
    Checking for errors is done at compilation stage 
    Example: C, java
 Dynamically Typed Languages 
    It does not require a compiler 
    If data type of the variable is known at the runtime it is called dynamically typed language 
    Checking for errors is done at runtime 
    Example: Javascript ,python 

2)Scripting language vs programing language:

   Programming Language
A programming language is a computer language that is used to communicate with computers using a set of instructions.
It is compiled language or compiler-based language.
It is used to develop an application or software from scratch.
It runs or executes independently and does not depend on the parent (exterior) program.
It uses a compiler to convert source code into machine code.
As it uses a compiler, hence the complete program is converted into machine code in one shot.
These languages are required to be compiled.
It is comparatively difficult to write code in a programming language, and it requires numerous lines of code for each task.
The development time in programming languages is high as more lines are required.
There is the high maintenance cost.
All programming languages are not scripting languages
It generates a .exe file.
Usually, programming languages do not support or provide very little support for user interface designing, data types, and graphic designing.
Some popular examples are C, C++, Java, Scala, COBOL, etc.

Scripting Language
A scripting language is a type of programming language designed for a runtime system to automate the execution of tasks.
It is interpreted language or interpreter-based language
It is used to combine existing components and automate a specific task.
It runs or executes inside another program.
It uses an interpreter to convert source code into machine code.
As it uses an interpreter, hence the program is converted into machine code line by line.
There is no need for compilation.
It is comparatively easy to write code in the scripting language, and it requires few lines of code for each task.
The development time in a scripting language as a smaller number of lines are required.
There is less maintenance cost.
All scripting languages are programming languages
It does not create a .exe file.
Scripting languages provide great support to user interface design, data types, and graphic design.
Some popular examples are Perl, Python, JavaScript, etc.

3)Difference between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP2:

   HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol
•	HTTP was invented by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in the years 1989–1991. 
•	It is the underlying communication protocol of World Wide Web. 
•	HTTP functions as a request–response protocol in the client–server computing model. 
•	HTTP standards are developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), culminating in the publication of a series of Requests for Comments (RFCs). 
•	HTTP has four versions — HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1, and HTTP/2.0. 
•	Now, the version in common use is HTTP/1.1 and the future will be HTTP/2.0.
HTTP/0.9 — The One-line Protocol
•	Initial version of HTTP — a simple client-server, request-response, telenet-friendly protocol
•	Request nature: single-line (method + path for requested document)
•	Methods supported:  GET only
•	Response type: hypertext only
•	Connection nature: terminated immediately after the response
•	No HTTP headers (cannot transfer other content type files), No status/error codes, No URLs, No versioning
HTTP/1.0 — Building extensibility
•	Browser-friendly protocol
•	Provided header fields including rich metadata about both request and response (HTTP version number, status code, content type)
•	Response: not limited to hypertext (Content type header provided ability to transmit files other than plain HTML files — e.g. scripts, stylesheets, media)
•	Methods supported: GET, HEAD, POST
•	Connection nature: terminated immediately after the response
Drawbacks of HTTP/0.9 and HTTP/1.0
•	Both HTTP/0.9 and HTTP/1.0 required to open up a new connection for each request (and close it immediately after the response was sent). 
•	Each time a new connection establishes, a TCP three-way handshake should also occur. 
•	For better performance, it was crucial to reduce these round-trips between client and server. 
•	HTTP/1.1 solved this with persistent connections.
HTTP/1.1 — The standardized protocol
•	This is the HTTP version currently in common use.
•	Introduced critical performance optimizations and feature enhancements — persistent and pipelined connections, chunked transfers, compression/decompression, content negotiations, virtual hosting (a server with a single IP Address hosting multiple domains), faster response and great bandwidth savings by adding cache support.
•	Methods supported: GET , HEAD , POST , PUT , DELETE , TRACE , OPTIONS
•	Connection nature: long-lived
HTTPS
•	Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP. It uses SSL/TLS for secure encrypted communications.
•	Originally developed by Netscape in mid-1990s, SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is a cryptographic protocol enhancement to HTTP, which defines how client and server should communicate with each other securely. TLS (Transport Layer Security) is the successor of SSL.
•	An HTTPS connection can protect the data transfer from the man-in-the-middle attacks and common security threats by providing bidirectional encryption for communications between a client and server.
 
•	Although HTTPS is secure by its design, the SSL/TLS handshake process consumes a significant time before establishing an HTTPS connection. It normally costs 1–2 seconds and drastically slows down the startup performance of a website.
HTTP/2.0 and the future
•	All above features are being used by major web servers and browsers today. 
•	But modern enhancements like HTTP/2.0, Server Side Events (SSE), and Websockets have changed the way that the traditional HTTP works.
